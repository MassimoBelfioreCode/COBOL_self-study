Repo with my COBOL study material and programs (Livello base).

COBOL Compiler Installation on your own machine
---
Instructions:

Open a new terminal window and type:  sudo apt install open-cobol

procede with installation.

At the end of installation you can check if everything gone good opening a new terminal window and typing:  cobc --version  

Now if you use just like me VS Code I reccomend to install the COBOL extension. It is represented with a Blue circle.
